# Real-Time Object Detection
Detect and recognize vehicleâ€™s license plate using Deep Learning in PyTorch 

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to detect and recognize license plate using deep learning. In order to detect licence we will use Yolo [(You Only Look One)](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) Deep Learning object detection architecture based on Convolution Neural Networks.
